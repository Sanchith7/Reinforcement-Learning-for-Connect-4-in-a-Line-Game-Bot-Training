# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Connect-4-in-a-Line-Game-Bot-Training
Welcome to the Connect 4 Reinforcement Learning Game Bot project! This project is all about designing and training an RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent that can play Connect 4, a classic two-player board game, with exceptional skill. The goal is to create an AI bot that can make optimal moves, strategize to win, and prevent the opponent from winning.

# Game Controls
To interact with the game, you can use the following controls:

1)Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate across different columns of the game board.

2)Press Enter to drop a coin into the selected column.

# Running the Code
To start training the computer to become a Connect 4 master, follow these steps:

1)Go to the main menu of the game. 

2)Select the "Train Computer" option.

During the training process, the computer will play a specified number of games, which you can provide as an argument to the program. The more games it plays, the better it becomes! After the training is complete, you'll have a highly proficient Connect 4 AI ready to challenge players.

Note: Every time you select the "Train Computer" mode, the training process starts anew from the beginning, so you can keep improving the AI's skills.

# Playing Against the Trained Computer
Once the computer has completed its training, you can put your skills to the test by playing against it:

1)Return to the main menu.

2)Select the "vs Computer" option.

Get ready for a challenging game as the AI will employ its newly acquired Connect 4 strategies.
